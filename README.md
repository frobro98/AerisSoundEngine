# AerisSoundEngine

The Aeris Sound Engine is a basic sound system for use in gaming. It supports playing and streaming sounds as well as some built-in dsp effects, such as reverb and echo. 

The plan was to have it be cross platform, but this project isn't going to be supported going forward. Whatever was useful in this project will be moved over to the [Musa engine](https://github.com/frobro98/Musa), once audio becomes a focus.
